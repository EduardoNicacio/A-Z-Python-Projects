Message Hiding in Image
This Python application allows you to hide a message within an image (PNG or JPG) and extract it later using a secret key. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Tkinter (usually included in standard Python installations)
Pillow (PIL) library for image manipulation
stegano library for hiding and revealing the message in the image
You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

For bash
pip install pillow stegano

How to Use
Run the program by executing the Python script.
The main window will appear with options to open an image, enter a secret key, hide a message, and show a message.
Click the "Open Image" button to select an image in which you want to hide the message. Supported formats are PNG and JPG.
Enter your secret key in the "Enter Secret Key" field. This key will be used to hide and reveal the message.
To hide a message, enter the message you want to hide in the "Hide Data" section.
Click the "Hide Data" button. If the secret key matches, the message will be hidden in the image, and the updated image will be displayed.
Click the "Save Image" button to save the image with the hidden message as "Secret file.png."
To reveal the hidden message, enter the same secret key and click the "Show Data" button. If the key matches, the hidden message will be displayed in the "Show Data" section.
Security Note
Ensure that you keep your secret key secure, as it is essential for both hiding and revealing the message. If you lose the secret key, you won't be able to recover the hidden message.

Limitations
This is a basic example of message hiding and extraction and is not suitable for highly secure applications. It uses the stegano library, which is primarily designed for educational and non-critical use cases. For more robust security, consider using specialized encryption and steganography techniques.

Credits
This project uses the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface.
It also relies on the Pillow (PIL) library for image handling.
The stegano library is used for hiding and revealing the message within the image.
