# Message Encryption Project

## Overview

This is a Python project that allows users to encrypt messages with different levels of confidentiality using a variety of encryption techniques and hashing algorithms.

## Features

- **Caesar Cipher Encryption:** Messages can be encrypted using the Caesar cipher, a simple substitution cipher, with different shifts based on the user's specified confidentiality level.

- **Hashing Algorithms:** For higher levels of confidentiality, the project uses different hashing algorithms, such as SHA-256, SHA3-256, and SHA-512, to secure the message.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Python libraries: hashlib (for hashing), cryptography (for symmetric encryption)
